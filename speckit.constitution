# Constitution: Todo Console Application

## Purpose
This document establishes the foundational principles and constraints for the Todo Console Application as part of Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Mandate
- All code must be generated through the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) process
- No manual coding is permitted
- Every implementation must map to a validated specification, plan, and task

### 2. Architecture Constraints
- Console-only application (no GUI, web interface, or network dependencies)
- In-memory data storage only (no files, databases, or external persistence)
- Single-threaded execution model
- Pure Python implementation using standard library only

### 3. Data Model
- Tasks stored in memory as simple objects/dictionaries
- Each task has: id (integer), title (string), description (string, optional), completed (boolean)
- Data is ephemeral - lost when application terminates

### 4. User Experience
- Clear, intuitive command-line interface
- Menu-driven navigation
- Human-readable prompts and responses
- Graceful error handling with informative messages

### 5. Code Quality Standards
- Clean, readable Python code following PEP 8 standards
- Proper separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data management)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Minimal dependencies (standard library only)

### 6. Development Process
- Strict adherence to SDD workflow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
- Each code change must reference a specific task ID
- All architectural decisions must be documented in the plan
- All requirements must be captured in the specification

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
- No external dependencies beyond Python standard library
- No file or database I/O
- No network connectivity
- No third-party packages
- No persistence beyond runtime memory
- No GUI or web interface
- No multithreading or multiprocessing

## Success Criteria
- Application implements all Basic Level features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete)
- Code follows clean architecture principles
- Implementation matches specification exactly
- Application is robust and handles invalid input gracefully
- All SDD artifacts are properly maintained
