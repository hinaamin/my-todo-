# Specification: Todo Console Application

## Overview
This document specifies the requirements for the Todo Console Application as part of Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development. The application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to manage their tasks in memory.

## User Stories

### 1. Add Task
As a user, I want to add a new task to my todo list so that I can keep track of things I need to do.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can provide a title for the task (required)
- User can optionally provide a description for the task
- System assigns a unique ID to the new task
- Task is stored in memory with completed status set to false by default
- System confirms successful addition of the task

### 2. View Task List
As a user, I want to view all my tasks so that I can see what I need to do.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System displays all tasks with their ID, title, completion status, and description
- Tasks are displayed in a readable format with clear column headers
- Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending tasks
- If no tasks exist, system indicates that the list is empty

### 3. Update Task
As a user, I want to update an existing task so that I can modify its details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can specify which task to update by ID
- User can update the title of the task
- User can update the description of the task
- System validates that the task exists before updating
- System confirms successful update of the task

### 4. Delete Task
As a user, I want to remove a task from my list so that I can clean up completed or irrelevant tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can specify which task to delete by ID
- System validates that the task exists before deletion
- System removes the task from memory
- System confirms successful deletion of the task

### 5. Mark Task Complete/Incomplete
As a user, I want to mark a task as complete or incomplete so that I can track my progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can specify which task to mark by ID
- User can toggle the completion status of the task
- System validates that the task exists before updating status
- System confirms successful status change

## Functional Requirements

### F-1: Task Management
- The system shall support creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks
- Each task shall have a unique identifier
- Each task shall have a title (required)
- Each task shall have an optional description
- Each task shall have a completion status (boolean)

### F-2: User Interface
- The system shall provide a menu-driven command-line interface
- The system shall display clear options for available actions
- The system shall provide feedback for all user actions
- The system shall handle invalid input gracefully

### F-3: Data Management
- The system shall store all tasks in memory only
- The system shall not persist data beyond the application lifecycle
- The system shall maintain data integrity during all operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Usability
- The system shall provide clear prompts and instructions
- The system shall display error messages in human-readable format
- The system shall be intuitive for users familiar with command-line interfaces

### NFR-2: Reliability
- The system shall handle invalid user input without crashing
- The system shall validate user input before processing
- The system shall maintain consistent state during operation

### NFR-3: Performance
- The system shall respond to user commands within 1 second
- The system shall handle at least 1000 tasks in memory without performance degradation

## Constraints
- The application must run in a console/terminal environment
- The application must use only Python standard library
- The application must not store data persistently
- The application must not connect to external services or networks

## Assumptions
- The user has basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- The user has Python 3.13+ installed on their system
- The application will run on a system with sufficient memory to store tasks

## Dependencies
- Python 3.13+ runtime environment
- Console/terminal access
