# AI Agents Used in This Project

This project was developed using AI agents to assist with various aspects of the development process.

## Primary Agent: Qwen Code

The primary AI agent used for this project is Qwen Code, which assisted with:

- Creating the project constitution, specifications, plan, and task breakdown
- Implementing the code following the Spec-Driven Development methodology
- Ensuring adherence to the architectural principles and requirements
- Providing code reviews and suggestions during development

## Development Process

The AI agent followed the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology:

1. Constitution: Establishing core principles and constraints
2. Specification: Creating detailed requirements and user stories
3. Planning: Designing the architecture and data flow
4. Tasks: Breaking down implementation work into atomic tasks
5. Implementation: Writing code following the specifications

## Tools and Technologies

The agent used standard Python 3.13+ development tools and followed clean architecture principles to create this console-based todo application.
